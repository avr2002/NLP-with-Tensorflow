    "\n",
    "- In the context of neural networks, it's a way to avoid the famous vanishing/exploding gradient problem, which in simple terms, can be explained as our loss function becoming too small or too large during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardization brings values b/w 0-1, and Normalization makes mean=0 and variance/std_dev = 1 for the features in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normally Standardization/Normalization is done before passing our data to the neural net. Though it is seen that, applying normalization to the subsequent outputs of the layers(each neuron) of the neural networks helps in achieving better performance/accuracy.\n",

    "    3. Why scale and shift the normalized outputs?\n",
    "\n",
    "        - In practice, not all features or layers in a neural network have the same importance. Some may be more or less relevant to the task at hand. By learning gamma and beta, the model can automatically adjust the scaling and shifting to account for these differences in scale & importance of layers, making the network more robust to various inputs.

    "2. No need to manually normalize/standardize your data before passing it to the neural network. Simply add a Batch Normalization layer before the first layer of the model.\n",

    "3. It also regularizes the model, a little bit, helping with overfitting. Although you might need to separately add regularization depending upon the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This is due to its inherent noise introduced by normalizing each mini-batch differently, which can reduce overfitting to some extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In addition to the reduced risk of overfitting, you can often use higher learning rates when batch normalization is employed, further accelerating the convergence of the network.\n",

    "- which is why it does not work well for smaller batch sizes (usually 16+)\n",
